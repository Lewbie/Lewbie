Hi I'm Lewis, I previously studied Software Engineering and have started getting back into it now with the hopes of finishing my degree in 2026.
I'm currently working my way through BootDev and I'm enjoying learning new things.
If you see any glaring issues in any of my public projects feel free to reach out and give me advice!
